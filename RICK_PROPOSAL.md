# Golden Question Contest Platform
## Scope & Implementation Plan

**Prepared for:** Rick
**Prepared by:** Shane Barron
**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Project:** Phase 2 - Daily Trivia Contest System

---

## Executive Summary

Building on the successful Phase 1 code lookup system, we're creating a complete daily trivia contest platform that will:

1. **Engage dog owners** with a daily "Golden Question" where first correct answer wins $10
2. **Provide property managers** with engagement analytics to justify your product value
3. **Prepare for sponsorship** with professional analytics, geolocation tracking, and scalable infrastructure
4. **Automate operations** so you focus on business development, not customer service

This platform transforms your doggy bag business from a simple product into an **engagement platform** that property managers will value and sponsors like Purina will want to fund.

## What Makes This Sponsor-Ready

When you pitch Purina, Petco, or Chewy, you'll show them:

1. **Proven Engagement:** "10,000 verified scans across 50 dog stations in Denver"
2. **Quality Audience:** "Geolocation proves these are real dog owners at physical locations"
3. **Cost Efficiency:** "$10 direct to consumer beats $50+ CPM on Facebook ads"
4. **Measurable ROI:** "Click-through rates, redemption rates, geographic distribution - all tracked"
5. **Professional Platform:** Clean admin interface, reliable delivery, legal compliance
6. **Scalability Demonstrated:** "Handled 300 winners in one month with zero issues"

**Your Revenue Model with Sponsors:**
- Sponsor pays $10/prize + platform fee (you earn $0.20-0.50 per redemption)
- At 300 winners/month: Sponsor pays $3,000, you earn $60-150 platform fee

## Next Steps

1. **Review this scope** - Does this match your vision? Any adjustments needed?
2. **Legal consultation** - Recommend having a lawyer review Terms/Conditions ($500-1k, but protects you)
3. **Tremendous account setup** - Sign up, complete verification, fund initial balance ($500 recommended)
4. **Question bank planning** - Who will write the daily trivia questions? (365+ needed for full year)
5. **Sticker design** - You mentioned designing the puppy sticker - when will assets be ready?
6. **Development kickoff** - Once approved, we begin Week 1

## Why This Investment Makes Sense

**This isn't just a trivia site. It's your business differentiation:**

- **Property managers** choose your bags because you provide resident engagement data
- **Sponsors** pay you to reach verified dog owners (Purina, Petco, Chewy partnerships)
- **You scale** from 1 property to 100 properties on the same platform
- **You prove ROI** with real data (not just "people like our bags")

**The foundation we're building now** becomes the platform generating sponsor revenue later. When Purina sees 10,000 monthly scans across 50 properties, that $10k+ in prizes they fund becomes a marketing channel that performs better than digital ads.

**This platform is an asset** that makes your physical product more valuable to property managers and opens revenue streams beyond bag sales.

## Questions or Adjustments?

This scope reflects everything we discussed over pizza, plus the technical and legal necessities we've identified. If anything needs adjustment or if you have questions about specific features, let's discuss before development begins.

**Looking forward to building this with you.**
